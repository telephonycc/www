title: Telephony Shutting Down
excerpt: Effective July 17th, 2021 Telephony will no longer allow new signups.

I'm two months into a 6 month goal that honestly just no longer excites me. 

My experience tells me that is always better to cut losses early than hang on to
the potential that this product will become more interesting to me.

The truth is that the problems I'm working on today should excite me, but don't, and I
know that as more users depend on this product, it will become more difficult to shut down
in the future.

Fret not, though! Saying no to this product means that I can say yes to other products
that I'm obsessed about working on - they are intrinsically motivating.
