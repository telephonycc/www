title: MVP Launch
excerpt: |
  I am using Telephony in production! I was able to set up two factor authentication with Mailchimp using one of my virtual numbers. It felt great.

Here's where I'm at feature-wise:

- users can purchase a number ($9/month)
- incoming sms is routed to email
- replies to the email will reply to the original sms with your new number

I'm not quite ready to open sign ups to the public internet, but I sent out a marketing email to handful of my earliest adopters - people I feel like would appreciate having been invited so early and maybe even up for giving feedback.

One thing I'm struggling with is the upfront payment requirement. It feels like a lot of friction before any value is realized. My primary motivator for that is to prevent any issues with spam. My previous product was constantly fighting different spam-related issues and I definitely do not want to do that again.
