## SMS conversations

Text messages are a first-class citizen here. This section demonstrates
how to receive and reply to text messages to your virtual number.

### Receiving an SMS

I'll use our public number as an example: [+1 (512) 538-2009](tel:15125382009). Anyone I interact with can send a text message to this number.

When Telephony receives an SMS to a virtual number, it sends an email to the owner of the virtual number with the contents of the text message.

### Sending an SMS

It is possible to send SMS messages via email by sending an email from your telephony account's email address to 12345678901@app.telephony.cc.

The **subject** will be ignored. The email's **body** will be used as the body of the text message.
